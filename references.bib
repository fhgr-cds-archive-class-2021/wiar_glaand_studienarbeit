  abstract = {The computational cost and memory demand required by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes simulations can become very high. Therefore, the application of convolutional neural networks (CNN) in this field has been studied owing to its capacity to learn patterns from sets of input data, which can considerably approximate the results of the CFD simulations with relative low errors. DeepCFD code has been taken as a basis and with some slight variations in the parameters of the CNN, while the net is able to solve the Navier{\textendash}Stokes equations for steady turbulent flows with variable input velocities to the domain. In order to acquire extensive input data to the CNN, a data augmentation technique, which considers the similarity principle for fluid dynamics, is implemented. As a consequence, DeepCFD is able to learn the velocities and pressure fields quite accurately, speeding up the time-consuming CFD simulations.},

  abstract = {A number of studies have found that today's Visual Question Answering (VQA) models are heavily driven by superficial correlations in the training data and lack sufficient image grounding. To encourage development of models geared towards the latter, we propose a new setting for VQA where for every question type, train and test sets have different prior distributions of answers. Specifically, we present new splits of the VQA v1 and VQA v2 datasets, which we call Visual Question Answering under Changing Priors (VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 respectively). First, we evaluate several existing VQA models under this new setting and show that their performance degrades significantly compared to the original VQA setting. Second, we propose a novel Grounded Visual Question Answering model (GVQA) that contains inductive biases and restrictions in the architecture specifically designed to prevent the model from 'cheating' by primarily relying on priors in the training data. Specifically, GVQA explicitly disentangles the recognition of visual concepts present in the image from the identification of plausible answer space for a given question, enabling the model to more robustly generalize across different distributions of answers. GVQA is built off an existing VQA model -- Stacked Attention Networks (SAN). Our experiments demonstrate that GVQA significantly outperforms SAN on both VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets. Interestingly, it also outperforms more powerful VQA models such as Multimodal Compact Bilinear Pooling (MCB) in several cases. GVQA offers strengths complementary to SAN when trained and evaluated on the original VQA v1 and VQA v2 datasets. Finally, GVQA is more transparent and interpretable than existing VQA models.},

  abstract = {Top-down visual attention mechanisms have been used extensively in image captioning and visual question answering (VQA) to enable deeper image understanding through fine-grained analysis and even multiple steps of reasoning. In this work, we propose a combined bottom-up and top-down attention mechanism that enables attention to be calculated at the level of objects and other salient image regions. This is the natural basis for attention to be considered. Within our approach, the bottom-up mechanism (based on Faster R-CNN) proposes image regions, each with an associated feature vector, while the top-down mechanism determines feature weightings. Applying this approach to image captioning, our results on the MSCOCO test server establish a new state-of-the-art for the task, achieving CIDEr / SPICE / BLEU-4 scores of 117.9, 21.5 and 36.9, respectively. Demonstrating the broad applicability of the method, applying the same approach to VQA we obtain first place in the 2017 VQA Challenge.},

  abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG) signal classification is a challenging task due to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the usual presence of artifacts from different sources. Different classification techniques, which are usually based on a predefined set of features extracted from the EEG band power distribution profile, have been previously proposed. However, the classification of EEG still remains a challenge, depending on the experimental conditions and the responses to be captured. In this context, the use of deep neural networks offers new opportunities to improve the classification performance without the use of a predefined set of features. Nevertheless, Deep Learning architectures include a vast number of hyperparameters on which the performance of the model relies. In this paper, we propose a method for optimizing Deep Learning models, not only the hyperparameters, but also their structure, which is able to propose solutions that consist of different architectures due to different layer combinations. The experimental results corroborate that deep architectures optimized by our method outperform the baseline approaches and result in computationally efficient models. Moreover, we demonstrate that optimized architectures improve the energy efficiency with respect to the baseline models.},

  abstract = {To realize efficient computational fluid dynamics (CFD) prediction of two-phase flow, a multi-scale framework was proposed in this paper by applying a physics-guided data-driven approach. Instrumental to this framework, Feature Similarity Measurement (FSM) technique was developed for error estimation in two-phase flow simulation using coarse-mesh CFD, to achieve a comparable accuracy as fine-mesh simulations with fast-running feature. By defining physics-guided parameters and variable gradients as physical features, FSM has the capability to capture the underlying local patterns in the coarse-mesh CFD simulation. Massive low-fidelity data and respective high-fidelity data are used to explore the underlying information relevant to the main simulation errors and the effects of phenomenological scaling. By learning from previous simulation data, a surrogate model using deep feedforward neural network (DFNN) can be developed and trained to estimate the simulation error of coarse-mesh CFD. In a demonstration case of two-phase bubbly flow, the DFNN model well captured and corrected the unphysical ``peaks'' in the velocity and void fraction profiles near the wall in the coarse-mesh configuration, even for extrapolative predictions. The research documented supports the feasibility of the physics-guided deep learning methods for coarse mesh CFD simulations which has a potential for the efficient industrial design.},

Machine learning (ML) offers a wealth of techniques to extract information from data that can be translated into knowledge about the underlying fluid mechanics. Moreover, ML algorithms can augment domain knowledge and automate tasks related to flow control and optimization. This article presents an overview of past history, current developments, and emerging opportunities of ML for fluid mechanics. We outline fundamental ML methodologies and discuss their uses for understanding, modeling, optimizing, and controlling fluid flows. The strengths and limitations of these methods are addressed from the perspective of scientific inquiry that considers data as an inherent part of modeling, experiments, and simulations. ML provides a powerful information-processing framework that can augment, and possibly even transform, current lines of fluid mechanics research and industrial applications.},

Basis for this code is an adaptive hierarchical data structure together with an efficient communication and (numerical) computation scheme that supports MPP. For a detailled scalability analysis, we performed several experiments on two of Germany's national supercomputers up to 140,000 processes.

This ability requires models to go beyond the literal understanding of commonsense. The system should not just treat objects as the entrance to query background knowledge, but fully ground commonsense to the visual world and imagine the possible relationships between objects, e.g., ``fork, can lift, food''. To comprehensively evaluate such abilities, we propose a VQA benchmark, CRIC, which introduces new types of questions about  C ompositional R easoning on v I sion and C ommonsense, and an evaluation metric integrating the correctness of answering and commonsense grounding. To collect such questions and rich additional annotations to support the metric, we also propose an automatic algorithm to generate question samples from the scene graph associated with the images and the relevant knowledge graph. We further analyze several representative types of VQA models on the CRIC dataset. Experimental results show that grounding the commonsense to the image region and joint reasoning on vision and commonsense are still challenging for current approaches.

  abstract = {Background Sexual segregation in vertebrate foraging niche is often associated with sexual size dimorphism (SSD), i.e., ecological sexual dimorphism. Although foraging behavior of male and female seabirds can vary markedly, differences in isotopic (carbon, {$\delta$}13C and nitrogen, {$\delta$}15N) foraging niche are generally more pronounced within sexually dimorphic species and during phases when competition for food is greater. We examined ecological sexual dimorphism among sympatric nesting Pygoscelis penguins asking whether environmental variability is associated with differences in male and female pre-breeding foraging niche. We predicted that all Pygoscelis species would forage sex-specifically, and that higher quality winter habitat, i.e., higher or lower sea ice coverage for a given species, would be associated with a more similar foraging niche among the sexes. Results P2/P8 primers reliably amplified DNA of all species. On average, male Pygoscelis penguins are structurally larger than female conspecifics. However, chinstrap penguins were more sexually dimorphic in culmen and flipper features than Ad{\'e}lie and gentoo penguins. Ad{\'e}lies and gentoos were more sexually dimorphic in body mass than chinstraps. Only male and female chinstraps and gentoos occupied separate {$\delta$}15N foraging niches. Strong year effects in {$\delta$}15N signatures were documented for all three species, however, only for Ad{\'e}lies, did yearly variation in {$\delta$}15N signatures tightly correlate with winter sea ice conditions. There was no evidence that variation in sex-specific foraging niche interacted with yearly winter habitat quality. Conclusion Chinstraps were most sexually size dimorphic followed by gentoos and Ad{\'e}lies. Pre-breeding sex-specific foraging niche was associated with overall SSD indices across species; male chinstrap and gentoo penguins were enriched in {$\delta$}15N relative to females. Our results highlight previously unknown trophic pathways that link Pygoscelis penguins with variation in Southern Ocean sea ice suggesting that each sex within a species should respond similarly in pre-breeding trophic foraging to changes in future winter habitat.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces Bayesian Flow Networks (BFNs), a new class of generative model in which the parameters of a set of independent distributions are modified with Bayesian inference in the light of noisy data samples, then passed as input to a neural network that outputs a second, interdependent distribution. Starting from a simple prior and iteratively updating the two distributions yields a generative procedure similar to the reverse process of diffusion models; however it is conceptually simpler in that no forward process is required. Discrete and continuous-time loss functions are derived for continuous, discretised and discrete data, along with sample generation procedures. Notably, the network inputs for discrete data lie on the probability simplex, and are therefore natively differentiable, paving the way for gradient-based sample guidance and few-step generation in discrete domains such as language modelling. The loss function directly optimises data compression and places no restrictions on the network architecture. In our experiments BFNs achieve competitive log-likelihoods for image modelling on dynamically binarized MNIST and CIFAR-10, and outperform all known discrete diffusion models on the text8 character-level language modelling task.},

Instead of declaring a learning system's dynamics by implicit nonlinearities, we construct networks of linear first-order dynamical systems modulated via nonlinear interlinked gates. The resulting models represent dynamical systems with varying (i.e., liquid) time-constants coupled to their hidden state, with outputs being computed by numerical differential equation solvers. These neural networks exhibit stable and bounded behavior, yield superior expressivity within the family of neural ordinary differential equations, and give rise to improved performance on time-series prediction tasks. To demonstrate these properties, we first take a theoretical approach to find bounds over their dynamics and compute their expressive power by the trajectory length measure in latent trajectory space. We then conduct a series of time-series prediction experiments to manifest the approximation capability of Liquid Time-Constant Networks (LTCs) compared to classical and modern RNNs.

  abstract = {Turbulent flows of practical relevance are often characterized by high Reynolds numbers and solid boundaries. The need to account for flow separation seen in such flows requires the use of (partially) resolving simulation methods on relatively coarse grids. The development of such computational methods is characterized by stagnation. Basically, only a few methods are regularly applied that are known to suffer from significant shortcomings: such methods are often characterized by the significant uncertainty of the predictions due to a variety of adjustable simulation settings, their computational cost can be essential because performance shortcomings need to be compensated by a higher resolution, and there are questions about their reliability because the flow resolving ability is unclear; hence, all such predictions require justification. A substantial reason for this dilemma is of a conceptual nature: the lack of clarity about the essential questions. The paper contrasts the usually applied simulation methods with the minimal error simulation methods presented recently. The comparisons are used to address essential questions about the required characteristics of the desired simulation methods. The advantages of novel simulation methods (including their simplicity, significant computational cost reductions, and controlled resolution ability) are pointed out.},

  abstract = {Many problems in science and engineering can be represented by a set of partial differential equations (PDEs) through mathematical modeling. Mechanism-based computation following PDEs has long been an essential paradigm for studying topics such as computational fluid dynamics, multiphysics simulation, molecular dynamics, or even dynamical systems. It is a vibrant multi-disciplinary field of increasing importance and with extraordinary potential. At the same time, solving PDEs efficiently has been a long-standing challenge. Generally, except for a few differential equations for which analytical solutions are directly available, many more equations must rely on numerical approaches such as the finite difference method, finite element method, finite volume method, and boundary element method to be solved approximately. These numerical methods usually divide a continuous problem domain into discrete points and then concentrate on solving the system at each of those points. Though the effectiveness of these traditional numerical methods, the vast number of iterative operations accompanying each step forward significantly reduces the efficiency. Recently, another equally important paradigm, data-based computation represented by deep learning, has emerged as an effective means of solving PDEs. Surprisingly, a comprehensive review for this interesting subfield is still lacking. This survey aims to categorize and review the current progress on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for PDEs. We discuss the literature published in this subfield over the past decades and present them in a common taxonomy, followed by an overview and classification of applications of these related methods in scientific research and engineering scenarios. The origin, developing history, character, sort, as well as the future trends in each potential direction of this subfield are also introduced.},

  abstract = {In the aerodynamic design, optimization of the pressure distribution of airfoils is crucial for the aerodynamic components. Conventionally, the pressure distribution is solved by computational fluid dynamics, which is a time-consuming task. Surrogate modeling can leverage such expense to some extent, but it needs careful shape parameterization schemes for airfoils. As an alternative, deep learning approximates inputs-outputs mapping without solving the efficiency-expensive physical equations and avoids the limitations of particular parameterization methods. Therefore, this paper presents a data-driven approach for predicting the pressure distribution over airfoils based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Given the airfoil geometry, a supervised learning problem is presented for predicting aerodynamic performance. Furthermore, we utilize a universal and flexible parametrization method called Signed Distance Function to improve the performances of CNN. Given the unseen airfoils from the validation dataset to the trained model, our model achieves predicting the pressure coefficient in seconds, with a less than 2\% mean square error.},

This paper proposes and tests an approach based on a structured assessment test for mathematical competencies in higher education and methods for statistical evaluation of the test. A case study is presented for the assessment of knowledge and skills for solving linear algebra and analytic geometry problems by first-year university students. The test includes three main parts{\textemdash}a multiple-choice test with four selectable answers, a solution of two problems with and without the use of specialized mathematical software, and a survey with four questions for each problem. The processing of data is performed mainly by the classification and regression tree (CART) method. Comparative analysis, cross-tables, and reliability statistics were also used.

Building high fidelity CFD models is computationally intensive and requires accurate modeling of the dependencies of the flow field around the aerodynamic system. We build the mesh based neural network for the nodes of the CFD mesh, on and around the aerodynamic geometry and use it to predict the high fidelity models from a low fidelity model. We call these networks mesh based neural networks as they encode the connectivity of the CFD mesh. We conduct experiments using a simulated CFD with pressure data from fluid flow fields, for the task of predicting high fidelity pressure using data from a low fidelity mesh. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach and opens up the possibility of using such systems for boot strapping high fidelity computations and their use in the real world.},

  abstract = {The adjoint method is used for high-fidelity aerodynamic shape optimization and is an efficient approach for computing the derivatives of a function of interest with respect to a large number of design variables. Over the past few decades, various approaches have been used to implement the adjoint method in computational fluid dynamics solvers. However, further advances in the field are hindered by the lack of performance assessments that compare the various adjoint implementations. Therefore, we propose open benchmarks and report a comprehensive evaluation of the various approaches to adjoint implementation. We also make recommendations on effective approaches, that is, approaches that are efficient, accurate, and have a low implementation cost. We focus on the discrete adjoint method and describe adjoint implementations for two computational fluid dynamics solvers by using various methods for computing the partial derivatives in the adjoint equations and for solving those equations. Both source code transformation and operator-overloading algorithmic differentiation tools are used to compute the partial derivatives, along with finite differencing. We also examine the use of explicit Jacobian and Jacobian-free solution methods. We quantitatively evaluate the speed, scalability, memory usage, and accuracy of the various implementations by running cases that cover a wide range of Mach numbers, Reynolds numbers, mesh topologies, mesh sizes, and number of CPU cores. We conclude that the Jacobian-free method using source code transformation algorithmic differentiation to compute the partial derivatives is the best option because it computes exact derivatives with the lowest CPU time and the lowest memory requirements, and it also scales well up to 10 million cells and over one thousand CPU cores. The superior performance of this approach is primarily due to its Jacobian-free adjoint strategy. The cases presented herein are publicly available and represent platform-independent benchmarks for comparing other current and future adjoint implementations. Our results and discussion provide a guide for discrete adjoint implementations, not only for computational fluid dynamics but also for a wide range of other partial differential equation solvers.},

  abstract = {Deep Learning has revolutionized vision via convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and natural language processing via recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, success stories of Deep Learning with standard feed-forward neural networks (FNNs) are rare. FNNs that perform well are typically shallow and, therefore cannot exploit many levels of abstract representations. We introduce self-normalizing neural networks (SNNs) to enable high-level abstract representations. While batch normalization requires explicit normalization, neuron activations of SNNs automatically converge towards zero mean and unit variance. The activation function of SNNs are "scaled exponential linear units" (SELUs), which induce self-normalizing properties. Using the Banach fixed-point theorem, we prove that activations close to zero mean and unit variance that are propagated through many network layers will converge towards zero mean and unit variance -- even under the presence of noise and perturbations. This convergence property of SNNs allows to (1) train deep networks with many layers, (2) employ strong regularization, and (3) to make learning highly robust. Furthermore, for activations not close to unit variance, we prove an upper and lower bound on the variance, thus, vanishing and exploding gradients are impossible. We compared SNNs on (a) 121 tasks from the UCI machine learning repository, on (b) drug discovery benchmarks, and on (c) astronomy tasks with standard FNNs and other machine learning methods such as random forests and support vector machines. SNNs significantly outperformed all competing FNN methods at 121 UCI tasks, outperformed all competing methods at the Tox21 dataset, and set a new record at an astronomy data set. The winning SNN architectures are often very deep. Implementations are available at: github.com/bioinf-jku/SNNs.},

Fluids are well described by the Navier{\textendash}Stokes equations, but solving these equations at scale remains daunting, limited by the computational cost of resolving the smallest spatiotemporal features. This leads to unfavorable trade-offs between accuracy and tractability. Here we use end-to-end deep learning to improve approximations inside computational fluid dynamics for modeling two-dimensional turbulent flows. For both direct numerical simulation of turbulence and large-eddy simulation, our results are as accurate as baseline solvers with 8 to 10{\texttimes} finer resolution in each spatial dimension, resulting in 40- to 80-fold computational speedups. Our method remains stable during long simulations and generalizes to forcing functions and Reynolds numbers outside of the flows where it is trained, in contrast to black-box machine-learning approaches. Our approach exemplifies how scientific computing can leverage machine learning and hardware accelerators to improve simulations without sacrificing accuracy or generalization.},

VQA is a task that can be used to evaluate a system's capacity to understand an image. It requires an intelligent agent to answer a natural language question about an image. The agent must ground the question into the image and return a natural language answer. One of the latest techniques proposed to tackle this task is the attention mechanism. It allows the agent to focus on specific parts of the input in order to answer the question. In this paper we propose a novel long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture that uses dual attention to focus on specific question words and parts of the input image in order to generate the answer. We evaluate our solution on the recently proposed Visual 7W dataset and show that it performs better than state of the art. Additionally, we propose two new question types for this dataset in order to improve model evaluation. We also make a qualitative analysis of the results and show the strength and weakness of our agent.},

Cognition is core to tasks that involve not just recognizing, but reasoning about our visual world. However, models used to tackle the rich content in images for cognitive tasks are still being trained using the same datasets designed for perceptual tasks. To achieve success at cognitive tasks, models need to understand the interactions and relationships between objects in an image. When asked ``What vehicle is the person riding?'', computers will need to identify the objects in an image as well as the relationships riding(man, carriage) and pulling(horse, carriage) to answer correctly that ``the person is riding a horse-drawn carriage.'' In this paper, we present the Visual Genome dataset to enable the modeling of such relationships. We collect dense annotations of objects, attributes, and relationships within each image to learn these models. Specifically, our dataset contains over 108K images where each image has an average of \$\$35\$\$objects, \$\$26\$\$attributes, and \$\$21\$\$pairwise relationships between objects. We canonicalize the objects, attributes, relationships, and noun phrases in region descriptions and questions answer pairs to WordNet synsets. Together, these annotations represent the densest and largest dataset of image descriptions, objects, attributes, relationships, and question answer pairs.},

We present the "Nine Motifs of Simulation Intelligence", a roadmap for the development and integration of the essential algorithms necessary for a merger of scientific computing, scientific simulation, and artificial intelligence. We call this merger simulation intelligence (SI), for short. We argue the motifs of simulation intelligence are interconnected and interdependent, much like the components within the layers of an operating system. Using this metaphor, we explore the nature of each layer of the simulation intelligence operating system stack (SI-stack) and the motifs therein: (1) Multi-physics and multi-scale modeling; (2) Surrogate modeling and emulation; (3) Simulation-based inference; (4) Causal modeling and inference; (5) Agent-based modeling; (6) Probabilistic programming; (7) Differentiable programming; (8) Open-ended optimization; (9) Machine programming. We believe coordinated efforts between motifs offers immense opportunity to accelerate scientific discovery, from solving inverse problems in synthetic biology and climate science, to directing nuclear energy experiments and predicting emergent behavior in socioeconomic settings. We elaborate on each layer of the SI-stack, detailing the state-of-art methods, presenting examples to highlight challenges and opportunities, and advocating for specific ways to advance the motifs and the synergies from their combinations. Advancing and integrating these technologies can enable a robust and efficient hypothesis-simulation-analysis type of scientific method, which we introduce with several use-cases for human-machine teaming and automated science.},

Most VQA approaches in literature targets at finding answers to the questions solely based on analyzing the given images and questions alone. Other works that try to incorporate external knowledge into VQA adopt a query-based search on knowledge graphs to obtain the answer. However, these works suffer from the following problem: the model training process heavily relies on the ground-truth knowledge facts which serve as supervised information --- missing these ground-truth knowledge facts during training will lead to failures in producing the correct answers. To solve the challenging issue, we propose a Knowledge Graph Augmented (KG-Aug) model which conducts context-aware knowledge aggregation on external knowledge graphs, requiring no ground-truth knowledge facts for extra supervision. The proposed KG-Aug model is capable of retrieving context-aware knowledge subgraphs given visual images and textual questions, and learning to aggregate the useful image- and question-dependent knowledge which is then utilized to boost the accuracy in answering visual questions. We carry out extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our proposed KG-Aug models against several baseline approaches on various datasets.},

We study \${\textbackslash}textit\{generative VLMs\}\$ that are trained for next-word generation given an image. We explore their zero-shot performance on the illustrative task of image-text retrieval across 8 popular vision-language benchmarks. Our first observation is that they can be repurposed for discriminative tasks (such as image-text retrieval) by simply computing the match score of generating a particular text string given an image. We call this probabilistic score the \${\textbackslash}textit\{Visual Generative Pre-Training Score\}\$ (VisualGPTScore). While the VisualGPTScore produces near-perfect accuracy on some retrieval benchmarks, it yields poor accuracy on others. We analyze this behavior through a probabilistic lens, pointing out that some benchmarks inadvertently capture unnatural language distributions by creating adversarial but unlikely text captions. In fact, we demonstrate that even a "blind" language model that ignores any image evidence can sometimes outperform all prior art, reminiscent of similar challenges faced by the visual-question answering (VQA) community many years ago. We derive a probabilistic post-processing scheme that controls for the amount of linguistic bias in generative VLMs at test time without having to retrain or fine-tune the model. We show that the VisualGPTScore, when appropriately debiased, is a strong zero-shot baseline for vision-language understanding, oftentimes producing state-of-the-art accuracy.},

A lot of efforts have been made to capture single-step language and visual interactions. However, answering complex questions requires multiple steps of reasoning which gradually adjusts the region of interest to the most relevant part of the given image, which has not been well investigated. To integrate question related object relations into attention mechanism, we propose a multi-step attention architecture to facilitate the modeling of multi-modal correlations. Firstly, an attention transfer mechanism is integrated to gradually adjust the region of interest considering reasoning representation of questions. Secondly, we propose a cross-modal gating strategy to filter out irrelevant information based on multi-modal correlations.

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a personalized dialogue generation system, which combines reinforcement learning techniques with an attention-based hierarchical recurrent encoderdecoder model. Firstly, we incorporate user-specific information into the decoder to capture user's background information and speaking style. Secondly, we employ reinforcement learning techniques to maximize future reward in dialogue, which enables our system to generate topic-coherent, informative and grammatical responses. Moreover, we propose three types of rewards to characterize good conversations. Finally, we compare the performance of the following reinforcement learning methods in dialogue generation: policy gradient, Q-learning, and actor-critic algorithms. We conduct experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model on two dialogue datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our model can generate better personalized dialogues for different users. Quantitatively, our method achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art dialogue systems in terms of BLEU score, perplexity, and human evaluation.},

  abstract = {Visual question answering requires a system to provide an accurate natural language answer given an image and a natural language question. However, it is widely recognized that previous generic VQA methods often exhibit a tendency to memorize biases present in the training data rather than learning proper behaviors, such as grounding images before predicting answers. Therefore, these methods usually achieve high in-distribution but poor out-of-distribution performance. In recent years, various datasets and debiasing methods have been proposed to evaluate and enhance the VQA robustness, respectively. This paper provides the first comprehensive survey focused on this emerging fashion. Specifically, we first provide an overview of the development process of datasets from in-distribution and out-of-distribution perspectives. Then, we examine the evaluation metrics employed by these datasets. Thirdly, we propose a typology that presents the development process, similarities and differences, robustness comparison, and technical features of existing debiasing methods. Furthermore, we analyze and discuss the robustness of representative vision-and-language pre-training models on VQA. Finally, through a thorough review of the available literature and experimental analysis, we discuss the key areas for future research from various viewpoints.},

  abstract = {Generating flow fields (such as pressure and velocity fields) in 3D space is a fundamental task in computational fluid dynamics (CFD), with applications across a vast spectrum of science and engineering problems. An important class of fluid flow problems in CFD is multi-phase flow, where dispersed solid particles are present in the fluid flow. Despite recent developments in deep learning (DL) for CFD applications, current state-of-the-art is still unable to model 3D flow fields, especially in multi-phase flow settings. It is with this goal that we introduce PhyFlow, a novel physics-guided deep learning architecture for modeling 3D multi-phase fluid flows, designed to mimic the popular projection method for solving fluid flows in CFD simulations. We demonstrate that PhyFlow generates high quality flow fields and yields a 49.61\% improvement over other state-of-the-art baselines. We also test the quality of PhyFlow based fields by employing them in downstream tasks like particle drag force prediction and demonstrate state-of-the-art results, improving upon the previous best models by 9.89\%. Finally, we demonstrate the consistency of PhyFlow predictions with known underlying physics governing equations. Our source code and data are available online *.*tinyurl.com/mjkcrsdw},

The proposed method is applied to a flow around a circular cylinder at the Reynolds number ReD=100ReD=100Re\_\{D\}=100 as a test case. The flow attributes are mapped into two modes in the latent space and then these two modes are visualized in the physical space. Because the MD-CNN-AEs with nonlinear activation functions show lower reconstruction errors than the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), the nonlinearity contained in the activation function is considered the key to improving the capability of the model. It is found by applying POD to each field decomposed using the MD-CNN-AE with hyperbolic tangent activation such that a single nonlinear MD-CNN-AE mode contains multiple orthogonal bases, in contrast to the linear methods, i.e. POD and MD-CNN-AE with linear activation. We further assess the proposed MD-CNN-AE by applying it to a transient process of a circular cylinder wake in order to examine its capability for flows containing high-order spatial modes. The present results suggest a great potential for the nonlinear MD-CNN-AE to be used for feature extraction of flow fields in lower dimensions than POD, while retaining interpretable relationships with the conventional POD modes.},

We demonstrate HFM for several physical and biomedical problems by extracting quantitative information for which direct measurements may not be possible. HFM is robust to low resolution and substantial noise in the observation data, which is important for potential applications.},

  abstract = {A major challenge in real-world reinforcement learning (RL) is the sparsity of reward feedback. Often, what is available is an intuitive but sparse reward function that only indicates whether the task is completed partially or fully. However, the lack of carefully designed, fine grain feedback implies that most existing RL algorithms fail to learn an acceptable policy in a reasonable time frame. This is because of the large number of exploration actions that the policy has to perform before it gets any useful feedback that it can learn from. In this work, we address this challenging problem by developing an algorithm that exploits the offline demonstration data generated by \{a sub-optimal behavior policy\} for faster and efficient online RL in such sparse reward settings. The proposed algorithm, which we call the Learning Online with Guidance Offline (LOGO) algorithm, merges a policy improvement step with an additional policy guidance step by using the offline demonstration data. The key idea is that by obtaining guidance from - not imitating - the offline \{data\}, LOGO orients its policy in the manner of the sub-optimal \{policy\}, while yet being able to learn beyond and approach optimality. We provide a theoretical analysis of our algorithm, and provide a lower bound on the performance improvement in each learning episode. We also extend our algorithm to the even more challenging incomplete observation setting, where the demonstration data contains only a censored version of the true state observation. We demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm over state-of-the-art approaches on a number of benchmark environments with sparse rewards \{and censored state\}. Further, we demonstrate the value of our approach via implementing LOGO on a mobile robot for trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance, where it shows excellent performance.},

  abstract = {In the present work, an efficient Reduced-Order Model is developed for the prediction of motion-induced unsteady pressure distributions. The model is trained on the basis of synthetic data generated by full-order Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. The nonlinear identification task is to predict a snapshot representing the pressure distribution for the current time step based on respective snapshots of previous time steps and applied excitation. Once a Reduced-Order Model is conditioned on training data, it can predict sequences of the pressure distribution in a recurrent manner based on the excitation signal. Hence, it is able to capture the motion-induced nonlinear unsteady aerodynamics for a given configuration at fixed free-stream conditions. In this way, computationally extensive CFD simulations can be substituted by the application of the more efficient Reduced-Order Model. The nonlinear behavior of the aerodynamic system is captured based on a deep convolutional neural network. The performance of the Reduced-Order Model is demonstrated based on the LANN (Lockheed-Georgia, Air Force Flight Dynamics Laboratory, NASA-Langley and NLR) wing performing high-amplitude pitching motion in transonic flow.

We then evaluate Kneedle's accuracy against existing algorithms on both synthetic and real data sets, and evaluate its performance in two different applications.},

  abstract = {Projections from cortical and subcortical limbic structures to the basal ganglia are predominantly directed to the ventral striatum. The present study investigated how the expectation of external events with behavioral significance is reflected in the activity of ventral striatal neurons. A total of 420 neurons were studied in macaque monkeys performing in a delayed go-no-go task. Lights of different colors instructed the animal to do an arm-reaching movement or refrain from moving, respectively, when a trigger light was illuminated a few seconds later. Task performance was reinforced by liquid reward in both situations. A total of 60 ventral striatal neurons showed sustained increases of activity before the occurrence of individual task events. In 43 of these neurons, activations specifically preceded the delivery of reward, independent of the movement or no-movement reaction. In a series of additional tests, these activations were time locked to the subsequent reward, disappeared within a few trials when reward was omitted, and were temporally unrelated to mouth movements. Changes in the appetitive value of the reward liquid modified the magnitude of activations, suggesting a possible relationship to the hedonic properties of the expected event. Activations also occurred when reward was delivered in a predictable manner outside of any behavioral task. These data suggest that neurons in the ventral striatum are activated during states of expectation of individual environmental events that are predictable to the subject through its past experience. The prevalence of activations related to the expectation of reward suggests that ventral striatal neurons have access to central representations of reward and thereby participate in the processing of information underlying the motivational control of goal-directed behavior.},

We introduce a new evaluation protocol and associated dataset (VQA-Rephrasings) and show that state-of-the-art VQA models are notoriously brittle to linguistic variations in questions. VQA-Rephrasings contains 3 human-provided rephrasings for 40k questions spanning 40k images from the VQA v2.0 validation dataset. As a step towards improving robustness of VQA models, we propose a model-agnostic framework that exploits cycle consistency. Specifically, we train a model to not only answer a question, but also generate a question conditioned on the answer, such that the answer predicted for the generated question is the same as the ground truth answer to the original question. Without the use of additional annotations, we show that our approach is significantly more robust to linguistic variations than state-of-the-art VQA models, when evaluated on the VQA-Rephrasings dataset. In addition, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the standard VQA and Visual Question Generation tasks on the challenging VQA v2.0 dataset.},

First, the development and accepted concepts of verification and validation (V\&V) and uncertainty quantification (UQ) in general computer simulations and CFD are reviewed. Subsequently, progress made in V\&V and UQ for urban aerodynamics and microclimate CFD simulations is described. The required or acceptable accuracy in this field has been discussed in several studies; however, challenges specific to applying CFD in this area should be recognized considering that the target phenomenon in urban aerodynamics and microclimates is complex. In addition, constructing a conceptual model is challenging and has many uncertainties. Furthermore, this field is characterized by significant spatial distributions of physical quantities, such as wind speed, temperature, and other scalar variables; thus, specific validation metrics and multilateral methods, including a conventional profile comparison, should be used. Therefore, the V\&V and UQ processes should be implemented thoroughly, considering the characteristics of urban aerodynamics and microclimates. Discussions presented in this paper are of utmost importance and very timely in terms of simulation quality controls, especially during this new era of machine learning and artificial intelligence-based models that started being applied to urban aerodynamics and microclimate predictions.},

  abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics is an invaluable tool for both the design and analysis of aerospace vehicles. Reliable error estimation techniques are needed to ensure that simulation results are accurate enough to be used in engineering decision-making processes. In this work, a framework for estimating error and improving solution accuracy is presented. A linearized error transport equation (ETE) is used to estimate local discretization errors. A truncation error estimation technique is proposed which combines aspects of higher-order residual methods and continuous residual methods. The equivalence between adjoint and ETE methods for functional error estimation is demonstrated. Using adjoint/ETE equivalence, the higher-order properties of adjoint methods are extended to ETE methods. Consequently, ETE error estimates are shown to converge to the true discretization error at a higher-order rate. ETE error estimates are then used to correct the entire primal solution, and by extension, all output functionals, to higher order. The computational advantages of this ETE approach are discussed. Results are presented for 1D and 2D inviscid and viscous flow problems on grids with smoothly varying and non-smoothly varying grid metrics.},

First the formal framework of Markov decision process is defined, accompanied by the definition of value functions and policies. The main part of this text deals with introducing foundational classes of algorithms for learning optimal behaviors, based on various definitions of optimality with respect to the goal of learning sequential decisions. Additionally, it surveys efficient extensions of the foundational algorithms, differing mainly in the way feedback given by the environment is used to speed up learning, and in the way they concentrate on relevant parts of the problem. For both model-based and model-free settings these efficient extensions have shown useful in scaling up to larger problems.},

  abstract = {Visual Question Answering (VQA) has attracted a lot of attention in both Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing communities, not least because it offers insight into the relationships between two important sources of information. Current datasets, and the models built upon them, have focused on questions which are answerable by direct analysis of the question and image alone. The set of such questions that require no external information to answer is interesting, but very limited. It excludes questions which require common sense, or basic factual knowledge to answer, for example. Here we introduce FVQA, a VQA dataset which requires, and supports, much deeper reasoning. FVQA only contains questions which require external information to answer. We thus extend a conventional visual question answering dataset, which contains image-question-answerg triplets, through additional image-question-answer-supporting fact tuples. The supporting fact is represented as a structural triplet, such as {$<$}Cat,CapableOf,ClimbingTrees{$>$}. We evaluate several baseline models on the FVQA dataset, and describe a novel model which is capable of reasoning about an image on the basis of supporting facts.},

Many previous works have made word-level 2D CNNs deeper to capture global representations of text. Three-dimensional CNNs perform excellently in CV tasks through spatiotemporal feature learning, though they are little utilized in text classification task. This paper proposes a simple, yet effective, approach for hierarchy feature learning using 3D CNN in text classification tasks, named Text3D. Text3D efficiently extracts rich information through text representations structured in three dimensions produced by pretrained language model BERT. Specifically, our Text3D utilizes word order, word embedding and hierarchy information of BERT encoder layers as features of three dimensions. The proposed model with 12 layers outperforms the baselines on four benchmark datasets for sentiment classification and topic categorization. Text3D with a different hierarchy of output from BERT layers demonstrates that the linguistic features from different layers have varied effects on text classification.}

  abstract = {Rectified Linear Units (ReLU) are the default choice for activation functions in deep neural networks. While they demonstrate excellent empirical performance, ReLU activations can fall victim to the dead neuron problem. In these cases, the weights feeding into a neuron end up being pushed into a state where the neuron outputs zero for all inputs. Consequently, the gradient is also zero for all inputs, which means that the weights which feed into the neuron cannot update. The neuron is not able to recover from direct back propagation and model capacity is reduced as those parameters can no longer be further optimized. Inspired by a neurological process of the same name, we introduce Synaptic Stripping as a means to combat this dead neuron problem. By automatically removing problematic connections during training, we can regenerate dead neurons and significantly improve model capacity and parametric utilization. Synaptic Stripping is easy to implement and results in sparse networks that are more efficient than the dense networks they are derived from. We conduct several ablation studies to investigate these dynamics as a function of network width and depth and we conduct an exploration of Synaptic Stripping with Vision Transformers on a variety of benchmark datasets.},

A hierarchical framework is designed to tackle the practical problems of VQA in a cascade manner including: (1) diverse visual semantics learning for comprehensive image content understanding; (2) enhanced multi-modal pre-training with modality adaptive attention; and (3) a knowledge-guided model integration with three specialized expert modules for the complex VQA task. Treating different types of visual questions with corresponding expertise needed plays an important role in boosting the performance of our VQA architecture up to the human level. An extensive set of experiments and analysis are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new research work.},

  abstract = {Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KVQA) requires external knowledge beyond the visible content to answer questions about an image. This ability is challenging but indispensable to achieve general VQA. One limitation of existing KVQA solutions is that they jointly embed all kinds of information without fine-grained selection, which introduces unexpected noises for reasoning the correct answer. How to capture the question-oriented and information-complementary evidence remains a key challenge to solve the problem. Inspired by the human cognition theory, in this paper, we depict an image by multiple knowledge graphs from the visual, semantic and factual views. Thereinto, the visual graph and semantic graph are regarded as image-conditioned instantiation of the factual graph. On top of these new representations, we re-formulate Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering as a recurrent reasoning process for obtaining complementary evidence from multimodal information. To this end, we decompose the model into a series of memory-based reasoning steps, each performed by a Graph-based Read, Update, and Control (GRUC) module that conducts parallel reasoning over both visual and semantic information. By stacking the modules multiple times, our model performs transitive reasoning and obtains question-oriented concept representations under the constrain of different modalities. Finally, we perform graph neural networks to infer the global-optimal answer by jointly considering all the concepts. We achieve a new state-of-the-art performance on three popular benchmark datasets, including FVQA, Visual7W-KB and OK-VQA, and demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our model with extensive experiments.

  abstract = {Visual Question Answering (VQA) requires a fine-grained and simultaneous understanding of both the visual content of images and the textual content of questions. Therefore, designing an effective `co-attention' model to associate key words in questions with key objects in images is central to VQA performance. So far, most successful attempts at co-attention learning have been achieved by using shallow models, and deep co-attention models show little improvement over their shallow counterparts. In this paper, we propose a deep Modular Co-Attention Network (MCAN) that consists of Modular Co-Attention (MCA) layers cascaded in depth. Each MCA layer models the self-attention of questions and images, as well as the guided-attention of images jointly using a modular composition of two basic attention units. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate MCAN on the benchmark VQA-v2 dataset and conduct extensive ablation studies to explore the reasons behind MCAN's effectiveness. Experimental results demonstrate that MCAN significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art. Our best single model delivers 70.63\${\textbackslash}\%\$ overall accuracy on the test-dev set.
